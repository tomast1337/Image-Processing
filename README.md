# Image Processing

## Getting Started

1. **Installation**: You can install the required dependencies using Poetry with `poetry install`, `poetry install --no-root` on github code space
 or manually. To get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

   - Python
   - NumPy
   - OpenCV-Python
   - IPykernel
   - Rich
   - Matplotlib
   - ImageIO

If you prefer to install them manually, please ensure that each of these dependencies is properly installed on your system.

Obs: On github code spaces you need to install `libgl` with:

```sh
sudo su
apt-get update && apt-get install libgl1 -y
```

2.**Running the Notebooks**: Once you have the dependencies set up, you can run the provided Jupyter notebooks to explore and experiment with image processing techniques.

Feel free to delve into the notebooks and explore the fascinating world of image processing!
